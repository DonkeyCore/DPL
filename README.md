# DPL
Donkey Programming Language

This is a language in Java, designed to be easy to use, and simple. Not made for extreme efficiency, or massive projects. Feel free to use this for any purpose you desire.

### Installation
DPL is compatible only with Java 8 and above.
<ol>
<li>Download the ZIP file, and compile it as a runnable JAR file.</li>
<li>Run using the following command: <pre>java -jar NAME.jar</pre>No arguments will create a UI to easily use. Add a file as a parameter to simply run that script.</li>
<li>Optional for Unix systems: Create a file in /usr/bin/ named "dpl" with the following code: <pre>java -jar ~/PATH/NAME.jar</pre>You can then make your DPL scripts executable and have a header with this code to run correctly without actually starting the DPL.jar:<pre>#!/usr/bin/env bash /PATH/dpl</pre></li>
</ol>
